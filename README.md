# simple_udp

Homework 2 
CS 5383 - Computer Networks 
For this homework you should implement a simple UDP client and server that you can execute on your 
personal computer. You can implement the program in any language you choose, and use any libraries. 
Do not copy a solu on from online sources. If you reference other sources, or use genera ve 
technologies, provide proper a ribu on. 
The lecture slides for week 3 contain a design for this homework, and sample implementa on in Python. 
This will involve crea ng a client and server program files. For the client, use the hostname ‘localhost’ to 
indicate your computer as the server address. Your client should read input from a local keyboard or file, 
and transmit it to your server. The server should respond with an appropriate message. Both the client 
and server should output these transac ons to the local console, which you’ll include in your 
submission. 
To test, launch 2 consoles, in one, first execute the server, and in the other, execute the client.  
For submission, please include screenshots of the client and server runs, as well as your client and server 
source code files, or a link to your repository.
